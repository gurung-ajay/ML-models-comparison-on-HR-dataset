# ML-models-comparison-on-HR-dataset
In this project, I created various Machine Learning models (Logistic Regrssion, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest) to compare which of them can perform the best at classifying the HR dataset.

In HR dataset, there are many features and based on that features, I built models to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not.

Out of all the models, Random Forest performed the best with f1 score = 0.983
