# ML-models-comparison-on-HR-dataset
In this project, I created various Machine Learning models (Logistic Regrssion, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest) to compare which of them can perform the best at classifying the HR dataset.

Using HR dataset, I built models to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not, based on the predictor features.

To download the dataset in Google Colabn run: !gdown 1g1nwk4k-h9FceEHKZc8ocfu_xp3xnZ8R

Out of all the models, Random Forest performed the best with f1 score = 0.983
