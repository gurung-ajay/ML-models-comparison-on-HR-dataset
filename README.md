# ML-models-comparison-on-HR-dataset
In this project, I created various Machine Learning models (Logistic Regrssion, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest) to compare which of them can perform the best at classifying the HR dataset.

Tools used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.express, Scikit learn

Using HR dataset, I built models to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not, based on the predictor features.

To download the dataset in Google Colab run:   !gdown 1g1nwk4k-h9FceEHKZc8ocfu_xp3xnZ8R

Out of all the models, Random Forest performed the best with f1 score = 0.983

I used f1 score for scoring because it can evaluate the model by considering the imbalance of data.
